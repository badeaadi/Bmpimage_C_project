# Bmpimage---Project
First year university project, written using the C language standard.  Using encryption and decryption techniques, the code is meant to create an uniquely enchiphered image and also make use of this one to get to the first one back. The second part of the project, the template matching functions succeeds in finding with high accuraccy hand-written letters on a page. 
Step 1:
"main.c" is used to run the program , with the headers in the same folder.
Step 2:
Then, one must choose the secret keys, two unsigned ints and the images to be encrypted. 
Step 3:
All the locations and the filenames must be written in the locations.txt textfile.
Step 4:
Run and proceed in encrypting, decrypting an image and then finding some hand-written numbers in another image.
